# CT Drive

CT Drive is a document management tool which is build on top of Google drive designed to create Google doc, Google sheet and organize your Google drive folders by providing better user experience all at one place. This tool allows us to manage documents across our organization or team efficiently by:

- Creating Google Docs.
- Establishing team-specific directories to control document access.
- Moving documents between folders.
  Marking documents as favorites and accessing recent documents easily.

## Why Use CT Drive ?

The main idea is to centralize all documents in one location rather than scattering them across Confluence, Notion, Google drive and other platforms. This tool is built on top of Google Drive.Using this tool we can maintain an organization-wide folder that will be accessible to everyone in the organization.
